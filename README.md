# 🐟 FishAI: Crypto Underwater Conversations

Welcome to **FishAI**! This is a lighthearted website where you can chat with an "AI" that thinks it's a fish. 🐠

But there's a twist! The AI doesn't respond in human language—it communicates exclusively in **blubs**, like a fish underwater. Whether you're asking about crypto prices or just saying hello, you'll always get a fishy response.

## 🎯 Main Idea
This project is just for fun—a parody of AI chatbots in the crypto space. Instead of providing insightful answers, the AI behaves as if it's underwater and only says things like:
- *"Blub blub bluuub!"*
- *"Blub? Blub!!"*
- *"Bluuuuuub!!!"*  

It’s an underwater adventure for crypto enthusiasts!
